Sure! Here’s a simple Terraform code example to create an AWS EC2 instance:

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

Explanation of the Syntax
Provider Block:
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

provider “aws”: Specifies the AWS provider.
region = “us-west-2”: Sets the AWS region where resources will be created.
Resource Block:
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

resource “aws_instance” “example”: Defines an AWS EC2 instance resource.
ami: Specifies the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID to use for the instance.
instance_type: Defines the type of instance (e.g., t2.micro).
Key Points
Blocks: The main structure in Terraform, such as provider and resource.
Arguments: Key-value pairs inside blocks that configure the resource or provider.
Labels: Identifiers for resources, like "aws_instance" and "example".
This code will create a basic EC2 instance in the specified AWS region. If you have any more questions or need further details, feel free to ask!
