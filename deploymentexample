Sure! Let’s break down the Kubernetes Deployment YAML you provided and then explain the concepts of ClusterIP and LoadBalancer.

YAML Breakdown
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-container
        image: <your-eks-repo-url>/my-image:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

apiVersion: Specifies the API version for the resource. Here, apps/v1 is used for Deployments.
kind: Defines the type of Kubernetes resource. In this case, it’s a Deployment.
metadata: Contains metadata about the resource, such as its name.
spec: Describes the desired state of the Deployment.
replicas: Specifies the number of pod replicas to run (3 in this case).
selector: Defines how to identify the pods managed by this Deployment using labels.
matchLabels: Specifies the labels to match (app: my-app).
template: Defines the pod template used to create new pods.
metadata: Contains labels for the pods (app: my-app).
spec: Describes the pod specification.
containers: Lists the containers to run in the pod.
name: The name of the container (my-container).
image: The container image to use (<your-eks-repo-url>/my-image:latest).
ports: Specifies the ports to expose (containerPort: 80).
ClusterIP and LoadBalancer
ClusterIP:

Definition: The default service type in Kubernetes, which exposes the service on an internal IP within the cluster.
Usage: Used for internal communication between different components of an application.
Example:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP

Explanation: This service will be accessible only within the cluster using the internal IP assigned by Kubernetes1.
LoadBalancer:

Definition: Exposes the service externally using a cloud provider’s load balancer.
Usage: Used for applications that need to be accessible from outside the cluster.
Example:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer

Explanation: This service will provision a load balancer in the cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP) and assign a public IP address to it, making the service accessible from the internet2.
